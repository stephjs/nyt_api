## API Work with [**The New York Times Article Search API**](https://developer.nytimes.com/)

- All searches require a **search term**. The NYT API looks for the search term in the headlines, bylines and article bodies of archived articles to return results containing the specific search term.

- **Start year** is an optional parameter that restricts responses to results with publication dates of the year specified or later.

- **End year**, also an optional parameter, restricts responses to results with publication dates of the year specified or earlier.
